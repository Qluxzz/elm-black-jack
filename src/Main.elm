{- Black Jack

   Game loop:

   All players in the game has to at least bet the minimum of the table
   The players are dealed two cards, the dealer is dealed two cards, but one is hidden

   Each player is given the choice to take another card or stand,
   When all players are standing or busted, the dealer flips the hidden card.

   If the dealers total sum is below the table minimum (often 17), the dealer takes cards until he reaches 17 or is bust.

   If the dealer busts, all players not busted win.
